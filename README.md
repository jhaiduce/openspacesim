# OpenSpaceSim

OpenSpaceSim is a real-time space simulation framework, designed to create games and other real-time simulations. It is a work in progress, features currently include

- Orbit propagation
- Attitude propagation
- Arbitrary number of bodies
- Actuator interface for spacecraft maneuvering

There is an example, propagatorInteractive, that demonstrates a spacecraft in Earth orbit, whose attitude can be controlled using a joystick or keyboard.
